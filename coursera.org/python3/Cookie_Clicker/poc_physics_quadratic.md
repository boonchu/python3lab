An example from ball physics
Games like Pong involve a ball bouncing around a closed domain. One interesting generalization of this situation is to allow several balls that bounce off of each other as well as the walls of the domain. This CodeSkulptor program allows the user to click in the canvas to spawn new balls, and displays the frame rate (number of draws per second) of the resulting simulation. As the number of balls increases, the time taken to compute all ball/ball collisions during each physics update in the simulation increases and the frame rate of the simulation begins to slow.

Since each one of the n balls is tested for collision against every other ball during the physics update, the total number of ball/ball collisions is approximately 12n2. (The factor of 12 arises because each pair of balls is tested for collision only once.) The left plot below shows an estimate of the time taken to compute all 12n2 of these collisions during a single update. Observe that this function has a parabolic shape and appears to be growing quadratically. (All times are computed on an ancient desktop so don't worry about the absolute scale.) The right plot shows the ratio of the running times and the function n2. Observe that the plot is trending towards a positive constant which confirms our analysis that the running time for this update method is growing quadratically.
