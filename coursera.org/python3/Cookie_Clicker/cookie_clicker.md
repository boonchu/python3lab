    * For the cheap strategy, you need to choose the item that has the lowest cost (cheapest)
    each time.  This may change throughout the simulation because an item's cost increases
    after you buy an item.

    * For the expensive strategy, this is just the opposite.  Choose the item that has the
    highest cost (most expensive) each time.  However, you also need to factor in how much
    time is left when deciding which item you can buy.
