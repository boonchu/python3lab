Quiz 2:

How many sequences of length four can be formed by choosing the first two elements in the sequences from a set of outcomes of size x and the last two elements in the sequences from a set of outcomes of size y? In this case, repeated outcomes are allowed.

Enter a math expression in x and y for the number of possible sequences of outcomes below.

my hypothetical license plate is a two-part code: the first part consists two letters and the second part consists of two digits.

    LLDD                  examples: AA11, EA39, QZ96, WF33,...

if we have 26 letters and 10 digits, how do you calculate the number of possible license plates? what would be the formula in terms of L and D?

in my analogy, by "a set of outcomes of size x", i meant the letters, with size 26 and "choosing the first two elements in the sequences from this set" would be picking any two letters. similarly, by "a set of outcomes of size y", i meant the digits, with size 10 and "choosing the last two elements in the sequences from this set" would be picking any two digits.

imagine another scenario: you have to create a four note musical motif but the first two notes must be on the piano and the last two notes must be on a regular flute. so for the first 2 notes (x) size is 88 and the last 2 notes (y) size is 36. how many different motifs (with the same metric & tempo - changing only the notes) can you write?
